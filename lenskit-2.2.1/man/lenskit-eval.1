.SH NAME
.PP
\f[B]lenskit eval\f[] \- run an offline evaluation of recommender
behavior and performance.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]lenskit\f[] [GLOBAL OPTIONS] \f[B]eval\f[] [OPTIONS]
[\f[I]TARGET\f[]...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[C]eval\f[] command runs a LensKit evaluation script to measure
the behavior and performance (such as recommendation or prediction
accuracy) of one or more recommender algorithms.
.PP
Evaluation scripts are written in Groovy, using an embedded
domain\-specific language for describing LensKit evaluations.
This is documented more in the LensKit manual; there is a link in See
Also.
.PP
The \f[B]lenskit eval\f[] subcommand serves the same purpose as the
now\-deprecated \f[B]lenskit\-eval\f[] command, with slightly different
invocation syntax.
Use \f[B]lenskit eval\f[] in new scripts and experiments.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \f[I]TARGET\f[]
Run the target \f[I]TARGET\f[] in the evaluation script.
If no targets are specified on the command line, the script is run
(which is sufficient for scripts that do not use targets), or the
default target specified by the script is run.
