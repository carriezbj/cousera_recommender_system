.SH NAME
.PP
\f[B]lenskit graph\f[] \- produce a GraphViz diagram of a recommender
configuration.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]lenskit\f[] [GLOBAL OPTIONS] \f[B]graph\f[] OPTIONS (#options)
\f[I]CONFIGS\f[]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[I]graph\f[] command loads a LensKit algorithm configuration from
one or more configuration files and produces a visualization of the
resulting object graph.
This visualization is in GraphViz DOT format, suitable for rendering
with \f[I]dot\f[](1).
Visualizing recommender configurations is often ueful for debugging
configurations and making sure they produce the objects you expect.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \f[I]CONFIG\f[]
A Groovy script containing a LensKit algorithm file in the LensKit
configuration DSL.
If there are multiple configurations, the are passed in order to
\f[C]LenskitRecommenderEngineBuilder\f[], so later configurations
override earlier ones.

.B \-o \f[I]FILE\f[], \-\-output\-file \f[I]FILE\f[]
Write the GraphViz file to \f[I]FILE\f[].
The default output file is \f[C]recommender.dot\f[].

.TP
.B \-\-domain \f[I]SPEC\f[]
Use the preference domain \f[I]SPEC\f[] as the preference domain in the
configuration.
\f[I]SPEC\f[] is of the form [\f[I]LOW\f[],\f[I]HIGH\f[]]/\f[I]PREC\f[];
the precision (and slash) can be omitted for continuously valued
ratings.
As an example, â€˜[0.5,5.0]/0.5' will be a domain from 0.5 to 5.0 stars
with a granularity of 1/2 star.

.TP
.B \-\-model\-file \f[I]FILE\f[]
Load a pre\-trained model from \f[I]FILE\f[].
In this mode, the configurations are applied as modifications to the
model rather than used to build a graph from scratch.
The mdoel file can be compressed.
