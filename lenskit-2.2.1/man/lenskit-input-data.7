.SH NAME
.PP
Specifying input data for LensKit commands.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Several subcommands of \f[B]lenskit\f[](1) allow for input data to be
specified.
They all take the same options to control their input data, documented
here.
.SH PRIMARY INPUT FILE
.PP
LensKit commands can read data in several different ways.
To give the recommendation or model\-building process some data to work
with, one of the following mutually\-exclusive options must be present:
.TP
.B \-\-ratings\-file \f[I]FILE\f[]
Read ratings from the delimited text file \f[I]FILE\f[].
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-csv\-file \f[I]FILE\f[]
Read ratings from the CSV file \f[I]FILE\f[].
This is identical to passing \f[C]\-\-ratings\-file=FILE\f[] with
\f[C]\-\-delimiter=,\f[].
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-tsv\-file \f[I]FILE\f[]
Read ratings from the tab\-separated file \f[I]FILE\f[].
This is identical to passing \f[C]\-\-ratings\-file=FILE\f[] with
\f[C]\-\-delimiter=^I\f[], but doesn\[aq]t require you to know how to
encode tab characters in your shell.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-events\-file \f[I]FILE\f[]
Read events from the text file \f[I]FILE\f[].
One event will be read per line, usually in a delimited column format
such as a CSV or TSV file.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-pack\-file \f[I]FILE\f[]
Read ratings from the packed rating file \f[I]FILE\f[].
Packed files can be created with the
\f[C]pack\-ratings\f[] (\f[B]lenskit\-pack\-ratings\f[](1)) command.
.RS
.RE
.SH SUPPLEMENTARY INPUT FILES
.PP
In addition to the rating or event data, you can also provide
.TP
.B \-\-item\-names \f[I]FILE\f[]
Load an item ID to name mapping from the CSV file \f[I]FILE\f[].
This will be used to provide an \f[C]ItemNameDAO\f[] and
\f[C]ItemDAO\f[].
It expects a CSV file where the first column is the item ID and the
second column is the name.
Standard CSV quoting is supported.
.RS
.RE
.SH INPUT OPTIONS
.PP
The options in this section provide additional control over the input.
.SS Delimited Ratings and Event Files
.PP
These options control how events (\f[C]\-\-events\-file\f[]) or ratings
(\f[C]\-\-ratings\-file\f[]) are parsed.
.TP
.B \-d \f[I]DELIM\f[], \-\-delimiter \f[I]DELIM\f[]
Use \f[I]DELIM\f[] as the delimiter for delimited text files.
Only effective in conjunction with \f[C]\-\-ratings\-file\f[] or
\f[C]\-\-events\-file\f[]; does not affect the parsing of
\f[C]\-\-item\-names\f[].
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-H \f[I]N\f[], \-\-header\-lines \f[I]N\f[]
Skip \f[I]N\f[] header lines at the top of the event or ratings file.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-t \f[I]TYPE\f[], \-\-event\-type \f[I]TYPE\f[]
When used with \f[C]\-\-events\-file\f[], specifies the type of events
that are being read from the file.
