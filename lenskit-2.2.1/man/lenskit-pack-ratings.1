.SH NAME
.PP
\f[B]lenskit pack\-ratings\f[] \- pack rating data into a binary file
for efficient access.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]lenskit\f[] [GLOBAL OPTIONS] \f[B]pack\-ratings\f[]
\f[I]OPTIONS\f[]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[C]pack\-ratings\f[] command packs rating data into a binary file
that LensKit can efficiently map into memory.
These files make many recommender operations significantly faster and
less memory intensive, including model building and recommendation with
certain algorithms.
.SH OPTIONS

.B \-\-help
Show usage help.

.TP
.B \-o \f[I]FILE\f[], \-\-output\-file \f[I]FILE\f[]
Write the resulting recommender model to \f[I]FILE\f[].
If not specified, the ratings will be packed into the file
\f[C]ratings.pack\f[].
.RS

.TP
.B \-\-no\-timestamps
Ignore timestamps in the input data and omit them from the packed
ratings.

This command also takes the standard input data
options (\f[B]lenskit\-input\-data\f[](7)).
.SH KNOWN ISSUES
.PP
If you want timestamped data, the input data must be sorted by
timestamp.
LensKit will eventually be able to sort data in the packing process, but
cannot currently do so.
