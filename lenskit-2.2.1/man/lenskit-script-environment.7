.SH NAME
.PP
Configuring the environment for interpreting LensKit scripts.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Several subcommands of \f[C]lenskit\f[](1) (./lenskit.1.html) interpret
scripts, either to configure recommenders or to run evaluations.
These subcommands support some common options for configuring the Java
environment in which these scripts are interpreted; this page documents
those options.
.SH SCRIPT ENVIRONMENT OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-C \f[I]URL\f[], \-\-classpath \f[I]URL\f[]
Add \f[I]URL\f[] (which can be a path to a local directory or JAR file)
to the classpath for loading the configuration scripts.
This URL can contain additional components for the recommenders.
This option can be specified multiple times to add multiple locations to
the classpath.

.B \-D \f[I]PROP\f[]=\f[I]VALUE\f[], \-\-define \f[I]PROP\f[]=\f[I]VALUE\f[]
Define the property \f[I]PROP\f[] to equal \f[I]VALUE\f[].
These properties will be available in the \f[C]properties\f[] object in
the interpreted script.
To set Java system properties, use the \f[C]JAVA_OPTS\f[] environment
variable (see \f[B]lenskit\f[](1) (lenskit.1.html)).
