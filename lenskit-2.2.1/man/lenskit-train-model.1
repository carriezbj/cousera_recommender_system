.SH NAME
.PP
\f[B]lenskit train\-model\f[] \- train a LensKit model and serialize it
to disk.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]lenskit\f[] [GLOBAL OPTIONS] \f[B]train\-model\f[]
OPTIONS (#options) \f[I]CONFIG\f[]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[C]train\-model\f[] command loads a LensKit algorithm
configuration, instantiates its shareable components, and writes the
resulting recommender engine to a file.
This file can then be loaded into an application or one of the other
LensKit commands to provide recommendations and predictions.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \f[I]CONFIG\f[]
A LensKit algorithm configuration file, written in the LensKit algorithm
DSL for Groovy.
If multiple configuration files are specified, they are used together,
with configuration in later files taking precedence over earlier files.

.B \-o \f[I]FILE\f[], \-\-output\-file \f[I]FILE\f[]
Write the resulting recommender model to \f[I]FILE\f[].
If this option is not specified, the model will be written to
\f[C]model.bin\f[] in the current directory.
If \f[I]FILE\f[] ends in \f[C]\&.gz\f[], the file will be
gzip\-compressed.
Compressed model files can be transparently read by LensKit, so this is
usually a good idea.

options (\f[B]lenskit\-input\-data\f[](7)) and script environment
options (\f[B]lenskit\-script\-environment\f[](7)).
