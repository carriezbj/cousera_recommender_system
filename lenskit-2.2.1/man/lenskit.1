.SH NAME
.PP
\f[I]lenskit\f[] \- a command\-line tool for LensKit
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]lenskit\f[] OPTIONS (#options) \f[I]subcommand\f[] [arguments]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The LensKit command line tool provides several capabilities for
examining, evaluating, and using LensKit recommender algorithms.
It primarily operates on LensKit algorithm configurations and eval
scripts written in the corresponding Groovy DSLs.
.PP
The various specific tools are exposed via subcommands, much like
\f[B]git\f[](1) and similar tools.
The subcommands are listed below (see Subcommands (#Subcommands)), and
each is described in more detail in its own manual page.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-\-help
Print usage instructions.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-log\-file \f[I]FILE\f[]
Write logging output to \f[I]FILE\f[].
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-d, \-\-debug
Increase verbosity, printing debug messages to the console.
By default, only messages at INFO and higher levels are logged.
The log file, if specified, always receives debug\-level output.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-debug\-grapht
Output INFO (or DEBUG, if \f[B]\-\-debug\f[] is also used) logging
messages from Grapht.
Grapht is pretty noisy, so by default its output is filtered to warnigns
and errors.
If you need to debug a problem that is occurring in Grapht, use this
option.
